# Grizzly Machine's Unity Utilities and Samples
This is a dumping ground for utilties and sample code that do not warrant their own repos (things that would be in gists if orgs could create gists).

## [Grid Scrolling Shader](/GridScrollingShader/)
This simple unlit shader endlessly scrolls through a grid of cells within a texture. It supports scrolling vertically or horizontally, and can work within a subset of the texture to allow for atlassing.

## [Batched Particle Systems](/BatchedParticleSystem/)
Contains a couple simple scripts that allow multiple instances of the same or similar particle systems to be combined into one particle system with multiple emitters.
