This is a dumping ground for utilties and sample code that do not warrant their own repos (things that would be in gists if orgs could create gists).

## Batched Particle Systems
Contains a couple simple scripts that allow multiple instances of the same or similar particle systems to be combined into one particle system with multiple emitters.
